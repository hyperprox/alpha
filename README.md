HyperProx is an open-source infrastructure management platform built on top of Proxmox VE. It consolidates the tools that homelab operators and MSPs currently juggle — proxy management, DNS, SSL, monitoring, AI-driven deployments, and network storage health — into a single interface deployed with one command.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperprox/alpha/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or with Docker Compose directly:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## The Problem

Running Proxmox in production means managing half a dozen separate tools that don't talk to each other:

- Nginx Proxy Manager for reverse proxying
- GoDaddy / Cloudflare for DNS
- Grafana + Prometheus for monitoring (manually configured)
- Separate SSH sessions to check node health, network mounts, storage status
- No visibility when a NAS goes offline and silently breaks monitoring

HyperProx replaces all of that with a single pane of glass — deployed in under five minutes.

| Nginx Proxy Manager full CRUD | ✅ Shipped |
| GoDaddy DNS — all record types, DDNS, stale IP detection, domain expiry | ✅ Shipped |
| Bundled Prometheus + Grafana — zero manual setup | ✅ Shipped |
| Real-time WebSocket dashboard — nodes, GPU, CEPH, HA, network | ✅ Shipped |
| Storage page — CEPH health, OSD status, VM/CT disk breakdown | ✅ Shipped |
| Monitoring page — node health, active alerts, Grafana embed | ✅ Shipped |
| AES-256-GCM encrypted credential store | ✅ Shipped |
| One-shot installer + first-run setup wizard | ✅ Shipped |
| AI deployment wizard (Ollama-powered, plan + confirm) | ✅ Shipped |
| LXC creation — template picker, node resource limits, storage with free space | ✅ Shipped |
| VM creation — ISO auto-detection, network config, storage picker | ✅ Shipped |
| CT/VM deletion with confirmation guard | ✅ Shipped |
| CT template + ISO auto-detection across all nodes and storage pools | ✅ Shipped |

---

## The Killer Feature

Type a natural language command. HyperProx handles everything:

```
Deploy Nextcloud at cloud.mydomain.com
```

1. Creates the LXC in Proxmox with appropriate resources
2. Configures the NPM proxy host
3. Creates the DNS A record
4. Polls for propagation
5. Requests the Let's Encrypt SSL cert
6. Returns the live URL

No tab switching. No SSH. No manual anything.

## System Requirements

### Minimum (no local AI)
- 2 CPU cores · 4GB RAM · 40GB storage

### Recommended
- 4 CPU cores · 8GB RAM · 100GB SSD

### With Local AI (Ollama + GPU)
- 4 CPU cores · 16GB RAM · 16GB VRAM · 100GB storage

### Prometheus Storage Planning
| Cluster Size | 90-day Retention |
|---|---|
| 5 nodes, 50 CTs | ~45GB |
| 10 nodes, 100 CTs | ~90GB |

The setup wizard calculates recommended storage automatically based on your cluster size.

---

## Architecture

Single `docker compose up` deploys the full stack:

| Service | Purpose | Port |
|---|---|---|
| hyperprox-frontend | Next.js dashboard | 3000 |
| hyperprox-api | Fastify API + WebSockets | 3002 |
| hyperprox-setup | First-run setup wizard | 3001 |
| prometheus | Metrics collection | 9090 |
| grafana | Visualization | 3003 |
| ollama | Local AI (optional) | 11434 |
| postgres | Config + state storage | 5432 |
| redis | Queue + cache | 6379 |
| nginx | Internal reverse proxy | 80/443 |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14+ · shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Node.js · Fastify |
| Real-time | WebSockets |
| Database | PostgreSQL · Prisma ORM |
| Queue | BullMQ · Redis |
| Monitoring | Prometheus · Grafana (bundled, auto-configured) |
| AI | Ollama (optional local) |
| Containers | Docker · Compose |
| CI/CD | GitLab CI → Docker Hub |

## Roadmap

### v1.0 — The Glue Layer

- **Smart Suggestion Engine** — cross-system awareness: new proxy host → suggest DNS record, WAN IP change → flag stale A records, SSL expiring → suggest renewal. Nothing acts without user confirmation.
- **Network Storage Health** — monitor CIFS/NFS mounts across all nodes, surface offline mounts as named alerts, correlate mount failures with downstream monitoring issues. AI-assisted remediation suggestions.
- **AI deployment wizard** — full end-to-end: container → proxy → DNS → propagation → SSL → live URL
- **Multi-provider DNS** — GoDaddy + Cloudflare + Namecheap simultaneously
- **Multi-instance proxy** — NPM + Traefik + Caddy + HAProxy + Pangolin simultaneously
- **Proxmox rolling updates** — CEPH-aware, per-node sequencing
- **HyperProx self-update** — one-click from UI
- **PBS backup monitoring** — datastore usage, job history, retention policies
- **GitOps export** — encrypted YAML backup/restore of entire HyperProx configuration

### v2.0 — The Platform

- **Bare metal Proxmox installer** — custom ISO/PXE with HyperProx baked in
- **Post-install bootstrap wizard** — networking, storage, cluster formation
- **Node expansion** — add new nodes to existing clusters from the dashboard
- **Multi-cluster management** — unlimited clusters from one UI
- **Cross-cluster live migration** — move VMs between clusters with zero downtime
- **ESXi live migration** — import VMware workloads directly into Proxmox
- **XCP-NG support** — manage Xen alongside Proxmox
- **VPN management** — WireGuard + Tailscale + Pangolin
- **CVE scanner** — detect known vulnerabilities across nodes and VMs
- **PVE hardening** — one-click security hardening for Proxmox hosts
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **LDAP / OIDC / SSO support**
- **Commercial licensing tier** — MSPs and enterprise deployments

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for full details.
